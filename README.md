Learning how to use github

Jamila here, I am learning how to code. I am a chemical engineer by training but I am fascinated by the world of data science and am looking to change careers. I am a traveler and am currently on a year-long trip around the world! I'm actually only 3 days away from reaching 365 days of traveling! :D
